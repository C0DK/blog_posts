I've always been a fan of the different scrum-inspired rituals, however after working fully remote for 9 months, I start to question whether it adds value, or is simply costing us an hour of productivity each day.

## What is the value of a standup?

> The daily stand-up is a short, daily meeting to discuss progress and identify blockers. The reason it’s called a “stand-up” is because if attendees participate while standing, the meeting should be kept short.

* [https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups)
    

I imagine many developers worldwide have some form of daily status meeting - I've at least had them wherever I've worked. Ideally, they should eliminate blockers and ensure everyone is on the same page. When you have a synchronous workday, it's an excellent way to kick off the day. If you have shy team members it's a great way to make sure everyone is getting the help they need, and that everyone is on the same page; working towards a common goal.

## What is the problem?

At my current job, and the one prior we all start our days at different times. I like to get up early and get my things done so that I can go home early. Others like to have a long morning with their kids, and then work throughout the night. When I worked on-prem, the standup was a great way to be in-the-know, about things that were only discussed verbally between coworkers.

However now, whenever anyone has an impediment they write it on Slack. If I write it early in the morning all my team members are able to see it, and any subsequent discussion is visible retroactively if you are off a given day. You are always in the know.

What about time? focus? I often fully zone out on our standups, not because I don't want to, but because my thoughts are on whatever project I work on - [Context switch is expensive](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/context-switching), and [we do it a lot](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-4952-your-calendar-your-priorities). I have found ways to improve focus by physically going somewhere else - i.e to the couch with a cup of coffee - it helps, however, it adds a context-switching buffer before and after the standup - so a meeting that should take 15 minutes (which could be shorter but there mandatory and nice small talk - which I'd argue also add value) - Then you have to go somewhere, and you have to wrap up what you were working on and afterward get back into it. Each standup probably takes 30+ minutes each day. (To be fair, an estimate I make with no data to back it up)

## What about togetherness

Since we operate fully remotely, we don't have the opportunity for casual water cooler discussions, which I, being a very extroverted individual, genuinely miss. However, we have found a way to incorporate some social interaction through occasional online gaming sessions within our consultancy. Currently we have it on schedule right before lunch, two days each week; you join if you have time, and if you don't, that's fine. It's a great way to meet everyone, have small talk, and have a laugh together.

We recently had to draw a bike together; the level of success is questionable, but our team spirit has never been higher:

I am quite lucky that our management does see the value in this. They obviously want us to stay, and improving togetherness is a great way of doing that. It adds work quality, and even though I don't feel like it some days (maybe you are in the zone on a given task), that is completely fine.

We do still have standups every other day, and your mileage obviously may vary, but for me, it adds much more value.

We currently rotate on the following games:

I can recommend it - even just for a fun one-off, even if you aren't remote!

## Am I just doing it wrong?

The standup can be more than the three famous questions:

> 1. What did I work on yesterday?
>     
> 2. What am I working on today?
>     
> 3. What issues are blocking me?
>     

It can also be a daily reflection on the [sprint goal](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-sprint-goal), (if you are working with sprints, and/or Scrum), or similar, but it hasn't been ever where I worked. So we might just be doing it wrong - We've tried in periods doing something like that, but end up moving away from it again. If that, however, is the only purpose, one could just as well post a daily (or once in a while) survey, of *"How confident are you in our ability to reach \[Sprint goal\]",* which might actually improve value, as it removes any [anchoring-bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)).

Others would argue for an [asynchronous daily standup](https://friday.app/p/asynchronous-daily-standups), and we tried that some years ago at a place I worked, where we used a bot to prompt us. It often resulted in people simply not answering, and we rarely used much time to check out each other's answers. If a standup does add value, it does solve some of the scheduling issues you might have, and that might be a solution for you. However, my core issue is that:

1. As we post a request-for-review in chat, people know when I am finishing a task.
    
2. As we always write "I am finished with X, can I help anyone with their tasks?", we know who is available, needing something to do
    
3. As the first step anyone does, when they reach a wall in any regard, is to say "I am blocked by X", or "I need someone to help pair program this with me" - we will never really be blocked by the time the standup comes around
    

Compared to the scheduled standup, which synchronizes expectation and alignment once a day, we never really go minutes without being up to date, with relevant facts. And if I am in a state of [deep focused work](https://todoist.com/inspiration/deep-work), I don't have to be interrupted by a team huddle.

## Are standups worthless?

Probably not. As with *actual* Agile teams, it's not a matter of doing a specific set of steps, but rather [embracing change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67833.Extreme_Programming_Explained) and adapting processes for the team, rather than adapting the team around certain processes. When improving communication and transparency, standups are a great formal way of getting on the same page and having a safe space to pose questions to a relevant stakeholder or a coworker, and it can be the correct step on a ladder of progress. I am simply arguing that it might not be the final step for every team.

I mentioned it internally at the consultancy I work at, and we have changed it into 2 standups per week (and 2 days of gaming). Despite these adjustments, I personally still don't perceive the added value from the two internal standups, however, it does add value for some coworkers; and as long as that is the case I happily comply. Nevertheless, if your team is open to trying out new approaches and you share my sentiments, then why not try a sprint without one?
